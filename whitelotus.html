		<h3>Summary</h3>
		<p style="color:black;"> White Lotus is on <a href="https://play.hbomax.com/page/urn:hbo:page:home">HBO Max</a> and takes place at a Hawaiian resort following the employees and guests. The guests include a family, a couple, and an interesting woman. Their paths cross in various ways as they navigate the resort and what it has to offer. Drama arises and the guests and employees resolve conflicts with themselves and one another.</p>


	
		<h3>Review</h3>
		<p style="color:black;"> 
		I thought this show was absolutely amazing. While only six episodes, the story line was very interesting and kept me wanting more. The show is satirical in a way and I was able to laugh at some of the scnes as they were not what I would expect from a drama.
