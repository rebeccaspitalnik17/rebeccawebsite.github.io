		<h1>Inventing Anna</h1>
	<article>
		<h3>Summary</h3>
		<p style="color:black;"> Inventing Anna is a limited series on <a href="https://www.netflix.com/browse">Netflix</a>. that follows the story of Anna Delvey, who is essentially a con-artist. Anna seems to have a lot of money, but in reality is in massive debt and has no means to pay for anything she has ever purchased. She messes up all of her relationships and ends up in jail due to this. Vivian Kent, a journalist at Manhattan magazine, strives to tell Anna's story through interviews with Anna's peers and past friends. <p/>

	
		<h3>Review</h3>
		<p style="color:black;"> 
		At first the show was slow but quickly picked up. As a journalism student, I enjoyed watching the scenes with Vivian Kent as she conducting interviews and was determined to tell annas story. The story of Anna herself was also very interesting and kept me on my toes as a viewer. </p>
