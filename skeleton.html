		<p style="color:purple"> My name is Rebecca Spitalnik and this is my website about all things TV! I am a current sophomore at <a href="http://wisc.edu">UW-Madison</a> majoring in journalism with a certificate in digital studies. As a college student, I often find myself very busy, but when I have a moment of downtime I always try to relax with a good show. On this website are my reviews of some of the shows I have watched. Hope you enjoy!</p>
