		<h3>Review</h3>
		<p style="color:black;">  I thought that Clickbait was overall a very action-packed and engaging series. I watched the show very quickly and was always curious as to what was going to happen next. I also think that in such a digital age, the show shed light on a very important topic in an interesting way. </p>
